# youtube-live-translate-chat-collector
When I am watching Hololive there will be some guy translate with start message with'[EN]' so I decide to collect it for reading

5 steps to go:
1) "pip install pytchat" or "python -m pip install pytchat"
2) copy my code and run it
3) put link as "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaaaaaaaaaaa" or id like "aaaaaaaaaa" to shell and press enter
4) check your clip what translator will always translate as and at case/sensitive case in condition()
5) enjoy~~

There are 2 versions 
python shell  : it will read up to down as normal
tkniker       : it will read down to upper according from past to present
I prefer tkinker version

If you don't have a video to test ther will always be translator on sheep chanel.Try it there!

PS: case sensitive that I have founded and add to my code
[en] [eng] [EN] [ENG] 【en】【eng】(en) (eng) [(smth)/en] or "she is talking about something" ore even with out[en] but use "she:smth" instead...
