# youtube-live-translate-chat-collector
When I am watching Hololive there will be some guy translate with start message with'[EN]' so I decide to collect it for reading
Using [pytchat]

### 5 steps to go:
1) "pip install pytchat" or "python -m pip install pytchat"
2) copy my code and run it
3) put link as "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaaaaaaaaaaa" or id like "aaaaaaaaaa" to shell and press enter
4) check your clip what translator will always translate as and at case/sensitive case in condition()
5) enjoy~~

### What command you can add to shell:
> after you put link in python shekk yoou will be able to modify collector using this program python shell
 * link:(new link)    : to change current collecting outube link
 * 
 * add/remove keyword :

### Test type:

there are 4 test type
If you don't like my main version you can use another version in [testtype folder]

If you don't have a video to test ther will always be translator on sheep chanel.Try it there!

PS: case sensitive that I have founded and add to my code
[en] [eng] [EN] [ENG] 【en】【eng】(en) (eng) [(smth)/en]([英訳/EN]) or "she is talking about something" ore even with out[en] but use "she:smth" instead...
