# youtube-live-translate-chat-collector
When I am watching Hololive there will be some guy translate with start message with'[EN]' so I decide to collect it for reading
Using [pytchat]

### 5 steps to go:
1) "pip install pytchat" or "python -m pip install pytchat"
2) copy my code and run it
3) put link as "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaaaaaaaaaaa" or id like "aaaaaaaaaa" to shell and press enter
4) check your clip what translator will always translate as and at case/sensitive case in condition()
5) enjoy~~

### There are 4 versions 

* [python shell]  : (easiest to modfy)    it will read up to down as normal

* [tkinter]       : it will read down to upper according from past to present

* [tkintet pyw]   : (best)        use with pythonw.exe have an option to add keyword and member while running(or you can run normally as .py)

* [for Android]   : (Success?)    using Pydroid3 in android copy and press this

I prefer tkinker version 

If you don't have a video to test ther will always be translator on sheep chanel.Try it there!

PS: case sensitive that I have founded and add to my code
[en] [eng] [EN] [ENG] 【en】【eng】(en) (eng) [(smth)/en]([英訳/EN]) or "she is talking about something" ore even with out[en] but use "she:smth" instead...

PS2: if you use formobile/ Tkinter pyw Version you can modify keyword by your self while running~~~~
